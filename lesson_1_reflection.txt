1)the bug was easily identifiable.
since the file was quite large hence it would have been 
impossible to find the bug without diff.

2)having access to the entire history would enable me to identify the changes i made in the file and also help me identify the bugs which come.

3) manual commit lest me commit when i think the code is to be committed.

4) saving multiple files has an advantage.

5) because i'll be able to go back at any time  i want.

6) i'll use it for large projects.
